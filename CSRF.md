### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Overview and Prevention

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** is a type of attack where an attacker tricks a victim into submitting a malicious request to a web application in which the victim is authenticated. This can lead to unauthorized actions, such as changing account settings, transferring funds, or making unauthorized purchases.

In a **CSRF attack**, the attacker takes advantage of the trust that a web application has in the authenticated user, manipulating the user’s browser to perform unwanted actions on their behalf.

### 1. **How CSRF Works**

#### a. **The CSRF Process:**
1. **Victim Authentication**: The victim logs into a legitimate website (e.g., a banking site).
2. **Attacker's Trap**: The attacker crafts a malicious link or form and tricks the victim into interacting with it (e.g., by embedding it in an email, or a webpage).
3. **Submission of Request**: The victim unknowingly submits a request (e.g., by clicking a button or loading an image) that triggers an action on the web application (e.g., transferring funds).
4. **Server Executes the Request**: Since the victim is already authenticated, the web server executes the request as if it were from the user, even though they did not intend to perform the action.

#### b. **Example of CSRF Attack**

Imagine a bank website that has a URL endpoint for transferring money:

```
http://bank.com/transfer?to=attacker_account&amount=1000
```

If the user is logged in and authenticated, visiting this URL would transfer $1000 to the attacker's account.

If an attacker sends a link like:

```html
<img src="http://bank.com/transfer?to=attacker_account&amount=1000">
```

and the victim, while logged into the banking site, clicks on the link, their browser will send the request using their session cookie. The server will interpret this as a legitimate transfer request, since the victim is authenticated.

### 2. **Impact of CSRF Attacks**

The potential consequences of a successful CSRF attack include:
- **Unauthorized Transactions**: Funds transfers or purchases.
- **Data Manipulation**: Changes in account details, such as email or password updates.
- **Unauthorized Content Changes**: Posting or modifying content on social media or forums.
- **Account Compromise**: Full control over the victim's account, including account takeover.

---

### 3. **How CSRF Attacks Occur**

The following conditions must be met for a CSRF attack to be successful:
1. **User is Authenticated**: The victim must be logged into the target web application.
2. **Session is Active**: The session cookie or token is valid.
3. **Vulnerable Web Application**: The target web application does not implement proper CSRF protection.

CSRF exploits a browser’s tendency to include authentication tokens, such as cookies, with every request to a web application. If the user is logged in, the browser automatically sends the session cookie, which validates the request.

### 4. **Preventing CSRF Attacks**

There are several strategies to prevent CSRF attacks, including token-based protection, ensuring same-origin policies, and validating requests.

#### a. **CSRF Tokens**
One of the most effective methods of preventing CSRF attacks is using **CSRF tokens**. A **CSRF token** is a unique, unpredictable value that is associated with a specific user session. It is included in forms and requests and validated on the server side to ensure that the request is legitimate.

##### Steps to Implement CSRF Tokens:
1. **Generate Token**: When a form or sensitive action is generated, the server creates a random CSRF token and stores it in the user’s session.
2. **Include Token in Form**: The token is sent as a hidden field in forms or as part of an HTTP request.
3. **Verify Token**: When the form or request is submitted, the server checks if the CSRF token matches the token stored in the session.

##### Example (in PHP):
```php
// Step 1: Generate a CSRF token and store it in the session
session_start();
$csrf_token = bin2hex(random_bytes(32));
$_SESSION['csrf_token'] = $csrf_token;

?>

<!-- Step 2: Include the CSRF token in the form -->
<form method="post" action="process.php">
    <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="<?php echo $csrf_token; ?>">
    <!-- Other form fields -->
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

<?php
// Step 3: Validate the CSRF token upon form submission
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    if (!isset($_POST['csrf_token']) || $_POST['csrf_token'] !== $_SESSION['csrf_token']) {
        die('CSRF validation failed');
    }
    // Process the form data
}
```

In this example, the server generates a token and stores it in the session. When the form is submitted, the server verifies that the token in the form matches the one in the session. If it doesn't match, the request is rejected.

#### b. **Same-Site Cookies**
Another effective mitigation strategy is setting the `SameSite` attribute on cookies. This prevents cookies from being sent with cross-origin requests.

There are three values for the `SameSite` attribute:
- **Strict**: Cookies are only sent in requests originating from the same site.
- **Lax**: Cookies are not sent with cross-site requests, except for top-level navigations (e.g., link clicks).
- **None**: Cookies are sent with all requests, including cross-origin requests (default for many browsers).

##### Example:
```http
Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; SameSite=Lax;
```

By setting the `SameSite` attribute to `Lax` or `Strict`, the browser will block CSRF attacks by preventing cookies from being sent with requests from another site.

#### c. **Check HTTP Referer Header**
The **Referer header** is sent with most HTTP requests and indicates the origin of the request. By checking the referer, the server can ensure that the request originated from the same domain as the web application.

##### Example in PHP:
```php
if (strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'], 'https://mywebsite.com') !== 0) {
    die('CSRF validation failed');
}
```

However, this method is less reliable because some users or networks may block the `Referer` header for privacy reasons.

#### d. **Use Custom Request Headers**
For AJAX requests, custom headers can be added to the request, and the server can validate these headers. Since browsers do not allow cross-origin JavaScript to set custom headers without proper CORS permissions, this method can block CSRF attacks.

##### Example (using Fetch API):
```javascript
fetch('https://example.com/api/update', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'X-CSRF-Token': csrfToken
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
});
```

The server can then verify the presence of the `X-CSRF-Token` header.

#### e. **Use POST Method for Sensitive Actions**
While not a foolproof solution, requiring sensitive actions to be performed using **POST** requests instead of **GET** requests helps reduce the risk. Attackers find it easier to embed GET requests into links or images.

### 5. **Examples of CSRF Prevention in Practice**

#### Example: A Secure Form with CSRF Token (in Python Flask):
```python
from flask import Flask, request, session, render_template_string
import os

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = os.urandom(24)

@app.route('/form', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def form():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        csrf_token = session.get('csrf_token')
        if not csrf_token or csrf_token != request.form.get('csrf_token'):
            return "CSRF token validation failed!"
        return "Form successfully submitted!"
    
    session['csrf_token'] = os.urandom(24).hex()
    return render_template_string('''
        <form method="post">
            <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="{{ csrf_token }}">
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    ''', csrf_token=session['csrf_token'])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

In this example, Flask generates a CSRF token and stores it in the session. When the form is submitted, the token is validated on the server. If the tokens do not match, the request is rejected.

### 6. **Testing for CSRF Vulnerabilities**

When testing a web application for CSRF vulnerabilities, you can:
1. **Examine Forms and Actions**: Look for sensitive forms or actions (such as account changes, transactions, etc.) and see if they include a CSRF token.
2. **Check if Cookies are Sent with Cross-Site Requests**: Using a browser’s developer tools, monitor whether cookies are sent with cross-site requests.
3. **Check Headers**: See if custom headers (such as `X-CSRF-Token`) are used for AJAX requests.

---

### 7. **Real-World Example of CSRF**

In 2010, Twitter was found vulnerable to a CSRF attack where an attacker could trick a user into following them simply by visiting a webpage that issued a CSRF request to the `follow` endpoint. The vulnerability was fixed by introducing CSRF tokens.

### Conclusion

**CSRF** is a serious vulnerability that can have devastating effects if not mitigated properly. To prevent CSRF attacks, web developers should implement CSRF tokens
