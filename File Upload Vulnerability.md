**File Upload Vulnerability**

### **Definition**
A file upload vulnerability occurs when an application improperly handles user-uploaded files, allowing attackers to upload malicious files that can compromise the system.

### **Technical Name**
- **CWE-434:** Unrestricted File Upload
- **CWE-98:** Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP

### **Common Exploits**
1. **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** – Attackers upload executable scripts (e.g., PHP, ASP, JSP) that execute arbitrary commands on the server.
2. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** – Malicious files force the server to make unauthorized requests to internal resources.
3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** – Malicious JavaScript is embedded in uploaded files and executed in users' browsers.
4. **Denial of Service (DoS)** – Large files or excessive uploads exhaust server resources.
5. **Overwriting Critical Files** – Attackers upload files with the same name as existing system files, leading to service disruption.

### **Mitigation Techniques**
- **Restrict File Types:** Allow only necessary file extensions (e.g., PNG, JPEG, PDF).
- **MIME Type Validation:** Verify that the file’s actual type matches its declared type.
- **Store Files Securely:** Save uploaded files outside the web root directory.
- **Rename Files:** Change the filename to a unique, random value before storing it.
- **Disable Execution:** Prevent execution of uploaded scripts via server configurations (e.g., disabling execution in upload directories).
- **Check File Content:** Use antivirus and security tools to scan files for malware.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Ensure only authorized users can upload files.

### **Best Practices**
- Implement **content filtering** to inspect file contents, not just extensions.
- Use **sandboxing** to test uploaded files in an isolated environment before allowing execution.
- Regularly update security patches to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

By implementing these security measures, the risks associated with file upload vulnerabilities can be significantly reduced.
