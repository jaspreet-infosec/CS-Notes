## **theHarvester Tool Documentation**

### **1. Installation**

#### **a. Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.x
- Git

#### **b. Installation Steps:**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the directory:**
   ```bash
   cd theHarvester
   ```
3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements/base.txt
   ```
   If you plan to use advanced features such as GUI or specific data sources, you may also need to install additional requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements/development.txt
   ```

### **2. Basic Usage**

TheHarvester can be run from the command line to gather information about a specific domain or IP address. 

#### **Basic Command Structure:**
```bash
python3 theHarvester.py -d <target_domain> -b <data_source>
```

#### **Example:**
```bash
python3 theHarvester.py -d anshinfotech.org -b all
```

### **3. Command-Line Options**

- **`-d <domain>`**: Specify the target domain you want to search (e.g., `anshinfotech.org`).
  
- **`-b <data_source>`**: Specify the data source to use for information gathering. You can use `all` to query all available sources. Common sources include:
  - `google`
  - `bing`
  - `baidu`
  - `dogpile`
  - `crtsh` (Certificate Transparency)
  - `hackertarget`
  - `linkedin`
  - `twitter`
  - `virustotal`
  - `anubis`

- **`-l <limit>`**: Set the limit for the number of results to fetch (where applicable).
  
- **`-f <filename>`**: Save the results to a file in HTML, XML, or JSON format.
  
- **`-s <start>`**: Start the search at a specific result number (useful for paginated results in search engines).
  
- **`-v`**: Enable verbose mode, which gives you more detailed output during the scan.

- **`-h`**: Display help information and list all available options.

#### **Example Commands:**
1. **Basic Domain Search:**
   ```bash
   python3 theHarvester.py -d anshinfotech.org -b google
   ```
   This command will search for information about `anshinfotech.org` using Google.

2. **Search with a Result Limit:**
   ```bash
   python3 theHarvester.py -d anshinfotech.org -b bing -l 100
   ```
   This command limits the results to 100 entries when querying Bing.

3. **Save Results to a File:**
   ```bash
   python3 theHarvester.py -d anshinfotech.org -b all -f results.html
   ```
   This command gathers information from all sources and saves it to `results.html`.

### **4. Advanced Options**

- **`-e <shodan_api>`**: Use Shodan for gathering IP information (requires an API key).
  
- **`-n`**: Perform a DNS reverse lookup.

- **`-t`**: Perform a DNS TLD expansion.

- **`-c`**: Perform a DNS brute force search.

- **`-p <proxy>`**: Set a proxy to use for the connection.

- **`-g <dns_server>`**: Use a specific DNS server for lookup.

### **5. Using theHarvester with API Keys**

Some data sources require API keys for access, such as Shodan, Twitter, or VirusTotal. To configure theHarvester with API keys:

1. **Edit theHarvester configuration:**
   - Open `api-keys.yaml` in theHarvester directory.
   - Add your API keys for the respective services.

2. **Example Configuration:**
   ```yaml
   shodan:
       key: YOUR_SHODAN_API_KEY
   virustotal:
       key: YOUR_VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY
   ```
3. **Running theHarvester with API-dependent sources:**
   ```bash
   python3 theHarvester.py -d anshinfotech.org -b shodan
   ```

### **6. Output Interpretation**

When you run theHarvester, it gathers and outputs various types of information:

- **Emails:** Email addresses associated with the target domain.
- **Subdomains:** Subdomains found under the target domain.
- **IPs:** IP addresses linked to the domain.
- **URLs:** URLs discovered during the search.

The information is typically output in a structured format that lists each type of data separately. If you've saved the results to a file, you can view them in your chosen format (e.g., HTML, XML, JSON).

### **7. Best Practices**

- **Use multiple data sources:** Each source may provide different pieces of information. Using `-b all` gives you a broader picture.
- **Respect rate limits:** Some data sources have rate limits, especially when using APIs. Be cautious and respectful of these to avoid getting blocked.
- **Regularly update theHarvester:** The tool is continuously updated, and new sources or bug fixes might be added. Ensure your version is up to date by pulling the latest changes from the repository.

### **8. Additional Resources**

- **Official GitHub Repository:** [theHarvester on GitHub](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester)
- **Community Discussions:** Search for common issues or feature requests on GitHub or security forums.
- **API Documentation:** Refer to the documentation for each API you plan to use with theHarvester (e.g., Shodan, VirusTotal).
