Here’s an updated concise list including file inclusion, parameter tampering, and others:

1. **SQL Injection**  
   * **Prob**: High – Manipulates database queries.

2. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**  
   * **Prob**: High – Injects malicious scripts in web pages.

3. **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**  
   * **Prob**: Medium – Forces users into unintended actions.

4. **RCE (Remote Code Execution)**  
   * **Prob**: Medium – Executes arbitrary code on a server.

5. **Broken Authentication**  
   * **Prob**: High – Allows unauthorized access.

6. **Insecure Deserialization**  
   * **Prob**: Medium – Modifies serialized objects for attacks.

7. **Sensitive Data Exposure**  
   * **Prob**: High – Weak encryption leaks data.

8. **File Inclusion (LFI/RFI)**  
   * **Prob**: Medium – Includes malicious files via local/remote paths.

9. **Parameter Tampering**  
   * **Prob**: Medium – Modifies URL or form parameters to bypass controls.

10. **Security Misconfigurations**  
   * **Prob**: High – Poor setup exposes systems.

11. **Insufficient Logging**  
   * **Prob**: Medium – Lack of monitoring hides attacks.

12. **Privilege Escalation**  
   * **Prob**: Medium – Gains higher-level access via flaws.

These are key vulnerabilities commonly targeted by attackers across various systems.
